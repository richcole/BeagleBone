Got automated booting working via the serial port. See README for
instructions.

Next step is to look up details on the jtag interface.

Also move the makefile around to support a directory full of C and asm
sources that all get compiled.

I still understand the linker.ld script very little. It has to be one
of the most obtuce systems.
