Got automated booting working via the serial port. See README for
instructions.

Next step is to look up details on the jtag interface.

Also move the makefile around to support a directory full of C and asm
sources that all get compiled.

I still understand the linker.ld script very little. It has to be one
of the most obtuce systems.

==

Changed from make to rake and split kernel build and serial build into
separate modules. Rake is superior to make, but perhaps a little
harder to understand when reading someone elses file.

Kernel at this stage is unchanged. I should be able to jump into C
code however.

==

Added code to be able to jump into C. Changed asm extension to .s.
